            <h1>Web developer</h1>
                <p>Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it's the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience. Web developers, or ‘devs’, do this by using a variety of coding languages. The languages they use depends on the types of tasks they are performing and the platforms on which they are working.
                    Web development skills are in high demand worldwide and well paid too – making development a great career option. It is one of the easiest accessible higher paid fields as you do not need a traditional university degree to become qualified.
                    The field of web development is generally broken down into front-end (the user-facing side) and back-end (the server side).

            <h3>What a Web Developer does</h3>
            Front-end web developers are responsible for how a website looks. They create the site's layout and integrate graphics, applications (such as a retail checkout tool), and other content. They also write web design programs in a variety of computer languages, such as HTML or JavaScript
            Back-end web developers are responsible for the overall technical construction of the website. They create the basic framework of the site and ensure that it works as expected. Back-end web developers also establish procedures for allowing others to add new pages to the website and meet with management to discuss major changes to the site.
            Webmasters maintain websites and keep them updated. They ensure that websites operate correctly, and they test for errors such as broken links. Many webmasters respond to user comments as well.
